    "# Brainlife analyses using Jupyter Notebooks and Python3\n",
    "\n",
    "This example notebook will guide the user through grabbing data for their project from the secondary warehouse, compiling data across the entire project, and analyzing and visualizing the compiled results on brainlife.io via the 'Analysis' tab. This example is written for python3, and uses one of the Python3 notebook types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within this notebook, I will guide the user through analyses comprising derivatives generated from three main datatypes available on brainlife.io, specifically neuro/anat/t1w & t2w. Specifically, I will guide the user through:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. Analyze the 'best-case' signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the preprocessed dMRI images\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. Analyzing tract profilometry data and macrostructural statistics (length, streamline count, volume) using the 61 tract segmentation generated from the White Matter Anatomy Segmentation app available on brainlife.io\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3. Analyze structural network matricies generated from dMRI using multiple the HCP-MMP atlas.\n",
    "    \n",
    "The functions provided in this notebook were designed for performing the many experiments provided in Hayashi & Caron et al (in prep), but should be a good starting point for you to get started on analyzing your project on brainlife.io!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Note regarding assumptions of data structures, both inputs and outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get started, it is important to note at the begging that the code in this notebook was designed mostly with a stereotypical data structure format in mind. For many of the datatypes, specifically the csv datatypes, follow the tidy format [https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10], where \"each column is a variable, every row is an observation, and every cell is a singular value\"[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html]. There will be a few common columns, specifically 'subjectID' denoting the brainlife subject ID, 'sessionID' denoting the session ID on brainlife (will be 1 if there is no session ID data available), 'structureID' denoting the tissue structure of interest (ex. white matter tract, cortical parcel, eeg node), and 'nodeID' denoting the sample number of the structure. 'nodeID' is included across many .csv-based datatypes to conform with profilometry data, which has multiple samples or nodes per structure. For single measures of a given structure, the nodeID for all structures will be 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, this is not the case for network adjacency matrices. Specifically with the network.json.gz files that come within the generic/network datatype, the resulting compiled data structure will be compiled as a json structure with a numpy array of the matrix for each subject and session. \n",
    "\n",
    "I will provide examples of these resulting structures later on in the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "I bring this up now to note that if you are not a fan of the style of the resulting data structures, or your data doesn't confirm to this style, you are free to alter this code to your deepest desires! I've attempted to do my best to comment and explain everything as much as possible for each section, function, and analysis. If there are any points where something is not working or you are not sure what the code is doing, feel free to email me at [bacaron245@gmail.com!]"

This includes many different manipulations and computations, including trimming nodes off profilometry data, computing mean dataframes, computing outliers and generating reference datasets, and some simple network adjacency matrix manipulations including binarizing, thresholding, and computing the mean witihin-network functional connectivity. \n",

My approach for this included identifying outliers for each structure and measure across a given project  by computing the mean distribution and identifying those with distances from that point greater than a percentile threshold. I then removed those data points, and recomputed the reference dataset. The references generated have been built-into many of the verification steps following Apps. The resulting dataframes are formatted in both csv and json structures."

    "The final set of functions deals with generating many useful visualizations and plots of the data, including scatterplots, violin plots, and tract profile plots. Within this are many useful wrapper functions that organize the data into useful structures for plotting. These scripts are very 'baked in', in that they are in a style that I like. However, many of these visualizations can be changed with simple alterations to the code. Many of the plots use packages like seaborn or matplotlib to make the visualizations, which both have extensive documentation to guide and help!"

I scrubbed the data of most of the relevant demographic information, as I was mostly only concerned with the participant's subject ID, age, and gender.\n",

    "The next step of the analysis pipeline for me is to collect and analyze the tract macrostructural (length, streamline count, volume) and microstructural (derived from dMRI models; i.e. profilometry) properties of white matter tracts. For this, I tracked and segmented 61 major white matter tracts from each participant, computed the macrostructural statistics for each tract, and then mapped measures of diffusion microstructure along each tract using tract profilometry.\n",
    "\n",
    "For my analyses, I trim the first and last 10% of nodes from the profiles, as these nodes are typically the closest to gray matter and thus the partial voluming effects here are greatest. Following cutting, I then computed the tract average for each tract, structural property, and participant.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of this example, I'll only be loading the tract profilometry data following cutting of the first and last nodes and computation of the mean value per tract. This is due to the file-size of the profilometry dataframe (>5GB). However, if you would like to investigate the data further, or have access to more RAM, I've included all of the data for this project in the data directory of the github repository."

    "## Collecting structural network adjacency matrices\n",
    "The next step of the analysis pipeline for me is to collect and analyze the structural density matrices generated from diffusion tractography. To do this, I created matrices of the streamline density between parcels in the HCP-MMP atlas for each participant. I then removed all nodes that were not present in at least 50% of participants, following methods outlined in McPherson et al (2021)[https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-021-02451-0]. Following this, I computed the network node degree for each node pair in the binarized and thresholded matrices, and computed the max node degree per participant. This data was then used in Figure XX to identify the relationship between max node degree and participant age."

    "## Removing outliers and creating reference datasets\n",
    "Once all of the appropriate data was collected, collated, and cleaned, I was now able to generate useful 'reference datasets' that can be used to identify potentially problematic participant data. I adopted a similar methodology as in the Pestilli et al (2014) LiFE paper which created \"reference datasets\", i.e. dataset of values of high-quality and high-diverse data, of properties derived from the LiFE model. The authors of this publication have released this data in the backend of the LiFE app here on brainlife.io, allowing users to directly compare their newly generated results with previously currated results.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, I took a similar approach across three large and diverse datasets: PING, HCP, and CAMCAN. For each data modality and structure, I computed the average value across many different models and measures including structural statistics derived from Freesurfer, diffusion microsturctural statistics derived from the DTI and NODDI models, and network measures such as max node degree from structural connectivity measures and average functional connectivity derived from fMRI. I then identified those data points that were outside the top and bottom 5% of the distribution, removed them, and recomputed the distribution. This newly cleaned distribution is the 'reference dataset' for that datatype, measure, and dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following iterating through many datatypes, measures, structures, and projects, I released the final reference datasets on github and we have incorporated the data into the validators for the apps that generate those particular datatypes!
